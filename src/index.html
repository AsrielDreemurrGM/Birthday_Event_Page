                <p class="birthday__details__description">
                    I was born on September 28, 2005. And at the age of 2, encouraged by my father, I already began
                    exploring the technology of that time, starting by drawing in Paint and, like any child,
                    as I grew up, I became interested in games.<br><br>
                    Around this time of my early childhood, I faced a new problem: most games were rarely in Portuguese,
                    a complete opposite to how most games come in diverse sets of languages right from launch nowadays.
                    I then began studying English, dedicating myself at school right from the start, a language I
                    continue to use and study to this day.<br><br>
                    At the age of 10, I started my first computer course, together with my first official English one,
                    learning the basics of the Office suite and advancing my English skills.<br><br>
                    When I was around 17 years old and graduating from school, I discovered my passion for
                    programming.<br><br>
                    Since then I have been fully dedicated to studying in this field, earning my English fluency
                    certificate in 2024 and my Full Stack Java Developer certificate in August 2025.<br><br>
                    This journey has shaped not only my skills but also who I am today, and I look forward to what comes
                    next.
